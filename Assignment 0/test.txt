The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog
Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex
Glib jocks quiz nymph to vex dwarf
Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow
How vexingly quick daft zebras jump
The five boxing wizards jump quickly
Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs
Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex
Quick zephyrs blow, vexing daft Jim
Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow
Two driven jocks help fax my big quiz
Five quacking zephyrs jolt my wax bed
The five boxing wizards jump quickly
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
Jinxed wizards pluck ivy from the big quilt
Crazy Fredrick bought many very exquisite opal jewels
We promptly judged antique ivory buckles for the next prize
A mad boxer shot a quick, gloved jab to the jaw of his dizzy opponent
Jaded zombies acted quaintly but kept driving their oxen forward
The job requires extra pluck and zeal from every young wage earner
